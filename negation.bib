@article{bergelson2013,
	abstract = {In this paper, Bergelson & Swingley examined children's comprehension of abstract words such as ``eat'' and ``all gone''.  These phrases generally involve referents that are not perceptually present or that are perceptually diverse, and therefore require more than simple associative cues for word learning.  The authors suggest that learning these words requires a more complex understanding of the role of intentionality in language.  To test comprehension of abstract words, children saw fourteen videos of different actions presented in yoked pairs.  While the videos were playing, parents listened to a utterance in headphones and repeated it for their child (e.g. ``look! all gone!  All gone!'').  Difference scores were computed to determine the increase in target looking following the parent's utterance.  Infants showed some comprehension at 10 months, and even great comprehension at 14 months.  This suggests that abstract words take longer to learn than concrete words, which elicit some comprehension as young as 6 months; however, comprehension can still be seen very early.  },

Studies in adults show an asymmetric relationship between mental representations of these basic dimensions of experience: Representations of time depend on space more than representations of space depend on time. Here we investigated the relationship between space and time in the developing mind. Native Greek-speaking children watched movies of two animals traveling along parallel paths for different distances or durations and judged the spatial and temporal aspects of these events (e.g., Which animal went for a longer distance, or a longer time?). Results showed a reliable cross-dimensional asymmetry. For the same stimuli, spatial information influenced temporal judgments more than temporal information influenced spatial judgments. This pattern was robust to variations in the age of the participants and the type of linguistic framing used to elicit responses. This finding demonstrates a continuity between space-time representations in children and adults, and informs theories of analog magnitude representation.},

	abstract = {This chapter begins with a brief history of the critical period concept. The terms critical period, sensitive period , or windows of opportunity are used in a number of different scientific fields, with slightly different meanings. Despite these varied, and sometimes conflicting, usages, a core scientific idea unites them. The core idea is that having a certain kind of experience at one point in development has a profoundly different impact on future behavior than having that same experience at any other point in development. This core idea places constraints on the kinds of experiments and evidence that are required to show that critical or sensitive periods exists. With this core idea in mind, the authors then look at 4 examples of popular critical or sensitive period claims and the experimental evidence that can be offered to support them. The 4 examples are: sensitive periods in the visual system (D. H. Hubel and T. N. Wiesel's blind kittens), a sensitive period for language learning, a sensitive period for music, and a sensitive period for early childhood intervention programs.

@article{boroditsky2001,
	abstract = {Does the language you speak affect how you think about the world? This question is taken up in three experiments. English and Mandarin talk about time differently---English predominantly talks about time as if it were horizontal, while Mandarin also commonly describes time as vertical. This difference between the two languages is reflected in the way their speakers think about time. In one study, Mandarin speakers tended to think about time vertically even when they were thinking for English (Mandarin speakers were faster to confirm that March comes earlier than April if they had just seen a vertical array of objects than if they had just seen a horizontal array, and the reverse was true for English speakers). Another study showed that the extent to which Mandarin--English bilinguals think about time vertically is related to how old they were when they first began to learn English. In another experiment native English speakers were taught to talk about time using vertical spatial terms in a way similar to Mandarin. On a subsequent test, this group of English speakers showed the same bias to think about time vertically as was observed with Mandarin speakers. It is concluded that (1) language is a powerful tool in shaping thought about abstract domains and (2) one's native language plays an important role in shaping habitual thought (e.g., how one tends to think about time) but does not entirely determine one's thinking in the strong Whorfian sense.},

Here we show that although toddlers (mean age: 24 months) readily learn predictive relationships between physically connected events, they do not spontaneously initiate one event to try to generate the second (although older children, mean age: 47 months, do; Experiments 1 and 2). Toddlers succeed only when the events are initiated by a dispositional agent (Experiment 3), when the events involve direct contact between objects (Experiment 4), or when the events are described using causal language (Experiment 5). This suggests that causal language may help children extend their initial causal representations beyond agent-initiated and direct contact events.},

In Study 2, an intervention teaching an incremental theory to 7th graders (N=48) promoted positive change in classroom motivation, compared with a control group (N=43).

After 4 weeks, children completed measures of intergroup attitudes and behavior. As predicted, the functional use of color groups affected children's attitudes toward group members, with children showing consistent biases favoring their own group. Children with higher levels of self-esteem showed higher levels of intergroup stereotyping.},

For example, many languages distinguish between sets and subsets (all vs. some), as well as between singular and plural sets (a cat vs. some cats). Three experiments explored the hypothesis that these representations are language specific, and thus absent from the conceptual resources of non-linguistic animals. We found that rhesusmonkeys spontaneously discriminate sets based on a conceptual singular--plural distinction. Under conditions that do not elicit comparisons based on approximate magnitudes or one-to-one correspondence, rhesusmonkeys distinguished between singular and plural sets (1 vs. 2 and 1 vs. 5), but not between two plural sets (2 vs. 3, 2 vs. 4, and 2 vs. 5). These results suggest that set-relational distinctions are not a privileged part of natural language, and may have evolved in non-linguistic species to support domain general quantitative computations.},

	abstract = {We investigated the relationship between the acquisition of singular--plural morpho-syntax and children's representation of the distinction between singular and plural sets. Experiment 1 tested 18-month-olds using the manual-search paradigm and found that, like 14-month-olds (Feigenson & Carey, 2005), they distinguished three objects from one but not four objects from one. Thus, they failed to represent four objects as `plural' or `more than one'. Experiment 2 found that children continued to fail at the 1 vs. 4 manual-search task at 20 months of age, even when told, via explicit morpho-syntactic singular--plural cues, that one or many balls are being hidden. However, 22- and 24-month-olds succeeded both with and without verbal cues. Parental report data indicated that most 22- and 24-month-olds, but few 20-month-olds, had begun producing plural nouns in their speech. Also, the success among the older children was due to those children who had reportedly begun producing plural nouns. We discuss a possible role for language acquisition in children's deployment of set-based quantification and the distinction between singular and plural sets.},

@article{baillargeon2004,
	annote = {	Baillargeon begins by pointing out the extremely early ages at which infants show sensitivity to occlusion, containment, and covering.  Different studies have found sensitivity to each of these event categories as early as 2.5 months.  For example, at this age infants show surprise if an object disappears behind one screen and then reappears behind another non-adjacent screen, demonstrating a sensitivity to occlusion (Aguiar & Baillargeon, 1999).  2.5-month-old infants also show surprise when an object is placed inside a container, but does not move with the container (containment; Hespos & Baillargeon, 2001b).  Finally, infants younger than 3 months show surprise when an obect is covered and the object does not move with it (covering; Wang, Baillargeon, & Paterson).  Baillargeon argues that it is more parsimonious to attribute infants understanding of these physical events to two basic, general principles of continuity and solidity (Spelke 1994), which could potentially be innate.   From these basic principles, more complex event concepts can be constructed.   
	Despite the fact that these different event categories can all be seen in some capacity by 2.5 months, the different variables that are relevant to each event category do not appear to generalize across categories.  For example,  the use of height as a variable in these different events emerges at different ages.  As early as 3.5 months, infants understand that tall objects should remain partially visible when occluded by a shorter object.  However, infants do not consider height as a variable in containment until 7.5 months -- infants younger than this show no surprise if a tall object is lowered into a short container and disappears entirely.  In the area of covering, infants do not show surprisal when a short cover covers a tall object until 12 months.  This is evidence that while the basic principles of continuity and solidity appear to be available to infants who are only a few months old, the parameters of specific event categories must be learned separately for each category.  
	Baillargeon provides further experimental evidence for her theory by showing that older infants will fail to detect solidity and continuity in situations involving variables that they have not yet incorporated into their event representations.  One such study looks at whether infants are sensitive to changes that occur during different events, or if they experience change blindness.  In this study, an occluder or a cover was lowered in front of or over a short object.  When the occluder/cover was lifted, the object had increased in height.  As predicted by Baillargeon's theory, children in both age groups (11-12 months) were sensitive to height changes during occlusion, but 11-month-olds did not notice the height change in the covering condition.   This study provides further evidence for Baillargeon's proposed theory that infant's lay theories of physics involve both early/innate concepts of continuity and solidity, as well as concepts that are learned later and are event-specific.

@article{hamlin2007,
	annote = {In a series of studies, Hamlin et al. use  explicit measures of children's preferences as well as implicit measures of their eye gaze to gain information about how children react to a novel agent interacting in either a positive (helping) or negative (hindering) way with an unknown third party.  In their first study, children viewed an abstract character (portrayed as a shape with eyeballs) attempting to get up a hill. Children then viewed alternating scenes in which a second character attempted to help the climber get up the hill, or a second character pushed the climber down the hill.  After being habituated to these scenes, children were given the choice to choose one of the characters, either the helper or the hinderer.  Children were significantly more likely to choose the helping character.  When children viewed scenes of the climber approaching either the helper or the hinderer, 10-month-olds looked more when the climber approached the hinderer, but 6-month-olds showed no preference.  A second study controlled for the possibility that children may simply prefer upwards motions to downwards ones, demonstrating that this is not the case -- it is something about the fact that the climber is a social agent that elicits this effect.  A third study introduced a neutral character and found that infants preferred the helper over the neutral character, but preferred the neutral character over the hinderer.  This study suggests that infants' are driven both by positive feelings for the helper, as well as an aversion to the hinderer.   Interestingly, in this third study, neither 10-month-old nor 6-month-old infants showed differential looking when viewing the climber approach the neutral agent v. the helper, or the hinderer v. the neutral agent.  },

	abstract = {The very early appearance of abstract knowledge is often taken as evidence for innateness. We explore the relative learning speeds of abstract and specific knowledge within a Bayesian framework and the role for innate structure. We focus on knowledge about causality, seen as a domain-general intuitive theory, and ask whether this knowledge can be learned from co-occurrence of events. We begin by phrasing the causal Bayes nets theory of causality and a range of alternatives in a logical language for relational theories. This allows us to explore simultaneous inductive learning of an abstract theory of causality and a causal model for each of several causal systems. We find that the correct theory of causality can be learned relatively quickly, often becoming available before specific causal theories have been learned---an effect we term the blessing of abstraction. We then explore the effect of providing a variety of auxiliary evidence and find that a collection of simple perceptual input analyzers can help to bootstrap abstract knowledge. Together, these results suggest that the most efficient route to causal knowledge may be to build in not an abstract notion of causality but a powerful inductive learning mechanism and a variety of perceptual supports. While these results are purely computational, they have implications for cognitive development, which we explore in the conclusion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {One of the most distinctive characteristics of humans is the capacity to learn from what other people tell them. Often new information is provided about an entity that is not present, requiring incorporation of that information into one's mental representation of the absent object. Here we present evidence regarding the emergence of this vital ability. Nineteen- and 22-month-old infants first learned a name for a toy and later were told that the toy had undergone a change in state (it had become wet) while out of view. The 22-month-olds (but not the 19-month-olds) subsequently identified the toy solely on the basis of the property that they were told about but had never seen. Thus, before the end of their 2nd year, infants can use verbal information to update their representation of an absent object. This developmental advance inaugurates a uniquely human and immensely powerful form of learning about the world.},

Infants who heard a label repeated twice looked longer at 2 different objects versus 2 identical objects, whereas infants who heard 2 distinct labels showed a different pattern of looking. Experiments 2 and 3 presented infants with object pairs that only differed in shape or color, and it was found that infants expected the different-shaped (but not the different-colored) objects to be labeled by distinct count nouns. Because the property of shape is a cue to kind membership and the property of color is not, these results suggest that even at the beginning of word learning, infants may expect distinct labels to refer to distinct kinds of objects.

	abstract = {Abstract:
This research examines whether infants actively contribute to the achievement of joint reference. One possibility is that infants tend to link a label with whichever object they are focused on when they hear the label. If so, infants would make a mapping error when an adult labels a different object than the one occupying their focus. Alternatively, infants may be able to use a speaker's nonverbal cues (e.g., line of regard) to interpret the reference of novel labels. This ability would allow infants to avoid errors when adult labels conflict with infants' focus. 64 16--19-month-olds were taught new labels for novel toys in 2 situations. In follow-in labeling, the experimenter looked at and labeled a toy at which infants were already looking. In discrepant labeling, the experimenter looked at and labeled a different toy than the one occupying infants' focus. Infants' responses to subsequent comprehension questions revealed that they (a) successfully learned the labels introduced during follow-in labeling, and (b) displayed no tendency to make mapping errors after discrepant labeling. Thus infants of only 16 to 19 months understand that a speaker's nonverbal cues are relevant to the reference of object labels; they already can contribute to the social coordination involved in achieving joint reference.},

and Sperber & Wilson have proposed that communication is assumed to be ``informative'' or ``relevant,'' but the predictions of these accounts are often informal or post-hoc. Here we propose a formal analogue to these accounts: that communicators choose what they want to say by how informative it would be about their intended meaning. We derive quantitative predictions about how this assumption would be used in language production and learning and test these predictions via two experiments. This work takes a first step towards formalizing the pragmatic assumptions necessary for effective communication in under-constrained, real-world situations.},

	annote = {ERP study looked at whether some of the effects seen in previous work on negation are due to the fact that often, affirmative sentences presented to particpants are pragmatically licensed, and negative sentences are not pragmatically licensed.  Their results showed that pragmatically unlicensed negative sentences show patterns similar to those seen in previous studies - i.e. in affirmative sentneces, there is a larger N400 response to false words than to true words, but in negative sentences the response is the same regardless of whether the sentences is true or false - but that in pragmatically licensed negative sentneces, there is a differential response in teh N400 between true and false words similar to that seen in affirmative sentences.  This research suggests a pragmatic account of processing negation, which suggests that at least some of the processing difficulty seen in negation is caused by whether the sentences is felicitous/expected rather than a semantic or syntactic effect of the negative particle. },

@book{mcneill1968,
	address = {Ann Arbor, MI},
	annote = {An analysis of the speech of two native Japanese-speaking children from 27 months to 34 months.  There are four types of negation in Japanese: nai (adj), indicating non-existence, nai (aux), indicating falsity (i.e. denial/truth-functional), iya, indicating a lack of internal desire (i.e. ``don't want''), and iiya, indicating entailment (i.e. denial).  The authors suggest that these semantic meanings can be organized around three dimensions: entailment-non-entailment, external-internal, and existence-truth.  The authors describe three stages that the Japanese-speaking children go through.  In the first stage, which both children were already at when data collection began (27 months), children use nai (adj) consistently and appropriately.  They also utter rejections but alternate between nai (adj) and iya.  Thus, at stage 1, children have mastered nonexistence negation and express rejection but have not mastered it's linguistic expression.  At stage 2 (~29 months), children begin using iiya (though often mispronouncing as iya), suggesting they are acquiring the concept of denial/truth.  At stage 3 (~31 months), children develop the correct use of iya, showing they have mastered the linguistic expression of rejection.  The data collection stopped before nai (aux) developed.  Indicated some universality to the concepts of negation, and also suggests that some concepts (i.e. rejection) emerge before their linguistic forms.  

Another point made in this paper is that Japanese negation is semantically complex but syntactically simple.  In Japanese, external negation is the syntactically correct form.  If external negation represents a universal deep structure, then children should not make any syntactic errors in their acquisition of negation.  McNeill and McNeill found this to be the case, providing evidence for deep structures and linguistic universals in syntax.},

	annote = {Provides evidence for the idea that although non-linguistic creatures or pre-linguistic children can use single, separate modules for simple reasoning, language is required to link information from multiple modules.  Examined specifically whether language is necessary to integrate information from a `landmark' module and a `geometric' module during a search task.  In this study, researchers examined adults' ability to reorient themselves in a plain white rectangular room compared to a rectangular room with one wall painted blue.  In the room with the blue wall, adults combined geometric information with information about the colored wall to locate the precise position of a hidden object e.g. ``to the left of the blue wall''.  In the room with only white walls, adults performed in a manner similar to children and rats (Hermer and Spelke, 1996, as cited in Hermer-Vazquez, Spelke, \& Katsnelson, 1999), searching equally in the correct corner as well as the geometric opposite corner for a hidden object.  However, in further studies, Hermer-Vazquez et al. (1999) found that when engaged in a verbal-shadowing task, in which participants listened to a story through headphones and repeated what they heard out loud simultaneously, adults performance was reduced to that of children and rats'.  When adults performed the same task with a rhythmic-interference task, they performed on par with non-shadowers.  This result suggests that when their linguistic capabilities are suppressed, adults are incapable of using the conjunction of geographic and non-geographic information to find an object in a searching task, providing support for Hinzen's theory that language is a necessary component in the combination of simple concepts into complex ones.  },

Head gestures were noted in bonobos and chimpanzees, but only bonobos displayed head shaking gestures similar to a human gesture for ``no''.  After observing the instances of head shaking behavior in bonobos, the researchers determined that 13 out of 49 head shaking gestures performed by the bonobos were used to indicate unwillingness to participate in an action.  However, while this study does suggest that bonobos may have a symbolic gesture that carries the meaning ``no'', it is more likely that the kind of negation that is being expressed here is rejection, rather than denial negation.  Thus, it is unclear whether this capability would require representational thought at all.  It is reasonable to assume that a non-verbal animal such as a bonobo would be capable of having a simple concept of ``negation'', such as the ability to refuse something, but it remains unclear whether it is possible to have an understanding of denial, and a general concept of negation, without the structures of language. },

@book{premack1976,
	annote = {David Premack conducted a longitudinal study in which he attempted to teach several chimpanzees, Sarah, Elizabeth, and Peony, a symbolic system based on plastic tokens that could be manipulated to form sentences.  One important aspect of this symbolic system was the inclusion of tokens for the concepts ``same'', ``different'', and ``not''.  Premack trained the chimps to use the symbols to form simple ``sentences'', such as: \begin{center} Apple SAME apple\\Apple DIFFERENT banana \end{center} The chimps were then trained to understand the negative token as negating an instruction: \begin{center} NO Sarah take apple \end{center} Sarah was also trained to respond YES or NO to questions such as: \begin{center} ? Apple SAME apple\\Correct response: YES\\?Apple SAME banana?\\Correct response: NO\end{center}Premack then tested the chimps on their response to novel sentences.  All of the chimps learned to inhibit their responses when they heard novel instructions with the negative particle NO (i.e. Sarah would take the cracker when she saw ``Sarah jam-cracker take'' but would not reach for any food when she saw ``No Sarah peanut butter-bread take'').  However, it is unclear how sophisticated this understanding was; it is possible that the chimps took ``no'' to mean ``don't move'' rather than ``don't perform this specific action''.   Sarah, the only chimp who was trained on answering Yes/No questions, had much more difficulty generalizing this knowledge to learn that that NO-DIFFERENT could be substituted for SAME.  Although Sarah was sometimes able to create the sentence ``Apple NO DIFFERENT Apple'' when the token for ``same'' was not present, her performance was riddled with errors.  Despite the fact that it is difficult to draw any concrete conclusions from a study with so few subjects and such varying results, Premack's work with chimpanzees raises a number of questions about the nature of animal thought and cognition.  If it is possible for a chimpanzee to form novel, albeit simple, sentences describing second order relations such as ``same'', ``different'', or ``not'', does this mean that the chimpanzee does in fact have an underlying system of propositional thought?  Or does this mean that teaching the chimpanzees a symbolic system actually provided them with simple structures that allowed them to construct mental representations in propositional form?  Although Premack's experiments provided an illuminating glimpse into the cognitive abilities of chimpanzees, there are still many unanswered questions.

	annote = {Conducted a study to examine the development of denial negation in children ages 1;1 to 2;7.  The study used an elicitation paradigm in which children were asked to respond either yes or no, rather than examining their spontaneous denials.  The researchers observed children while they read a picture book with their mothers.  During this activity, researchers asked children yes/no questions about the picture-book that they were engaged with.  This task required children to evaluate the truth or falsity of a proposition (embedded within the Y/N question) based on the facts that they were given by the picture book.  Hummer et al. interpreted ``no'' responses as denials, since denial negation requires one to evaluate the truth of a proposition in this way.  The researchers found that children were most likely to produce the denial ``no'' between 20 and 25 months, similar to the ages at which Pea found spontaneous denial negation emerging.  However, due to the fact that Hummer et al. found that these forms of ``no'' emerged rapidly, with no errors, the researchers rejected Pea's 1980 proposal that different types of negation follow different developmental paths.  Hummer et al. instead use their data as support for the continuity theory of negation development, arguing that children's understanding of denial ``no'' derives from their earlier understanding of negative terms.  },

	annote = {Cross-linguistic, longitudinal observation of 11 children (2 English-speaking, 4 Korean-speaking, and 5 French-speaking), ages 1;7-3;4.  Examined the emergence between forms and functions, defining functions as different ways children use negation, and categories as defined by the emergence of forms that are specific to a certain function.  Distinguished between independent forms, which use a single term to negate a proposition in the preceding context (e.g. `no'), and syntactic forms, which encompasses both general negation (a negative element + a predicate to negate a proposition) and syntactic negation (forms used in specific contexts).  Also distinguished between nonlinguistic differences between categories, i.e.  differences between the contexts and types of propositions that negation occurs in, as well as linguistic differences between categories, in which different linguistic forms are used for different categories.  Identified 9 categories:  nonexistence (an expected object is not present), rejections (negation of another's action), prohibition (negation of one's own action), failure (an expected action is not occurring), denial (negation of a linguistically represented proposition), inability (negation of a physical ability, e.g. `I can't'), epistemic negation (negation of knowledge, e.g. `I don't know'), inferential negation (negation of inferred beliefs of others), and normative negation (negation that expresses a general violation of expectations).  Defined three developmental phases of negation.  In phase 1, nonexistence, prohibition, rejection, and failure emerge.  In phase 2, denial, inability, and epistemic negation emerge.  In phase three, normative and inferential negation emerge.  Nonexistence, rejection, prohibition, and failure all had primarily nonlinguistic differences (though nonexistence did emerge with specific forms), whereas the others were differentiated using specific linguistic forms.  This was taken as evidence that categories such as nonexistence, rejection, prohibition, and failure are preceded by the development of cognitive concepts which then map onto linguistic forms.  However, in phases 2 and 3, children seem to be using language to develop more complex concepts about negation.  Identified three different relationships between form and function: old forms express new functions, new forms express new functions, and new forms differentiate old functions.},

The authors develop a probabilistic, expectation-based theory of syntactic comprehension.  Surprisal theory and probabilistic models make accurate predictions about how sentences are represented, and about the level of processing difficultly for specific words in a sentence.  Sentence comprehension is incremental - we start processing before we finish the sentence.  Expectations about upcoming words are implicit in the parsing of a sentence, rather than explicitly calculated.  

The predicted difficulty of a word w is equal to it's surprisal, i.e. the negative log-probability of w in a sentential context.  Surprisal mediates the relationship between structural representation and comprehension difficulty.  Surprisal values correspond to average reading times.

	annote = {Designed a study to examine whether pragmatic constraints such as the context that a negation was presented in would affect how participants responded.  Wason presented subjects with a string of 8 red or blue dots, 7 of which were one color and 1 of which was the remaining color.  In the Exceptionality group, the string of dots was numbered 1-8, while in the Ratio group, the string of dots was not numbered.  Subjects were asked to produce a sentence describing the dots in their own words, and then were asked to evaluate the truth or falsity of sentences such as ``circle number 7 is red'' /``circle number 4 is not blue'' (Exceptionality group) or ``exactly 7 circles are red'/``exactly 1 circle is not blue'' (Ratio group).  Participants were significantly slower to respond to negative statements about dissimilar items in the Ratio group (i.e. ``exactly 1 circle is not blue'' in context where 7 of the circles were blue) than in the Exceptionality group (i.e. ``circle number 4 is not blue'' in contexts were the rest of the circles were blue).  In addition, in the Ratio group participants tended to mention the dissimilar dot last in their descriptions of the stimuli, i.e. ``seven circles are blue and one is red'', whereas in the Exceptionality group participants were more likely to describe the unusual dot in terms of a residual class, i.e. ``circle number 4 is red and the rest are blue''.  The differences in how participants described the dots, combined with the different reaction times seen in response to the dissimilar negative sentences, suggests that the processing of negative sentences in which some expected characteristic is denied is facilitated by the presence of a context that sets up an exceptional and residual class.},

Children were shown two pictures, and then heard either an affirmative sentence matching one of the pictures, or a sentence negating the scene of the same picture.  Children were slightly more likely to look to the matching picture when they heard an affirmative sentence than when they heard a negation.  That is, if a child saw pictures of a girl sitting and a girl sleeping, that child was more likely to look to the picture of the girl sleeping if she heard ``The girl is sleeping'' than if she heard ``The girl is not sleeping'', providing some evidence that children were correctly comprehending the denial negations.  However, the differences seen in children's looking preferences were not statistically significant.  In addition, only two children in this study were below 19 months, and age was not examined in the analysis, making it difficult to determine precisely when the comprehension of negation emerges.  },

Analyzed natural speech samples from three children (Brown corpus: Adam, Eve, and Sarah), ages 18, 26, and 27 months at the beginning of the study.  They outlined three stages of negation that children go through before they begin producing adult-like negation.  The first of these stages, often referred to as "external negation", is a period marked by a tendency for young children to place the negative element at the front of the sentence, i.e. \begin{center} No the sun is shining \cite{klima1966} \end{center} In stage two children's negatives begin to follow the structure Nominal - Aux(neg) - Predicate/Main Verb, where children's negations generally take the form of can't, don't, and not.  They found that at this stage, children were only producing auxiliary verbs in negative forms (not questions or declarative utterances).  At stage 3, children's negations became even more adult-like, with the basic structure Nominal - Auxiliary - Predicate/Main Verb.  At this point children are producing auxiliary verbs in other constructions as well, and there is also evidence for transformations in children's constructions, such as optional `be' deletion and `do' deletion.  These researchers argued that what appear to be errors in children's speech actually represented a systematic child "grammar", with it's own set of rules.},

Results showed that while 30 -- 36 month olds responded to false affirmatives with a denial ``no'' significantly more than they did with true affirmatives, only some 24-month-olds produced ``no'' responses to false affirmatives, and 18-month-olds made almost no responses at all.

	annote = {Conducted an analysis of the types of negation seen in children's early speech.  Pea's study examined 6 children from 8 to 21 months, and examined both gestural and linguistic negations produced by these children over the course of a year.  Pea identified five different categories.  Rejection was the first to emerge in Pea's sample (gestures: 10-14 months, utterances: 12-15 months).  Disappearance (negations referring to an object that has recently disappeared or an action that has recently ceased), emerged consecutively with spoken rejection (utterances: 13-15 months), followed by self-prohibition (negations used in situations where the child is engaging in an action or interacting with an object that has been forbidden in the past; gestures: 11-16 months, utterances: 14-21 months), and unfulfilled expectation (negations used in cases where an object is not in its expected location or an expected action cannot occur; gestures: 14 months, utterances: 16-18 months).  The last to develop was Truth-Functional negation, or negations used by the child in situations in which the child is engaging in an action or interacting with an object that has been forbidden in the past (utterances: 19-23 months). },
