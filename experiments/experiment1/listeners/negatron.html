  <b>THIS IS A DEMO EXPERIMENT. NO DATA WILL BE COLLECTED. </b>
  <br><br>

  In this experiment, you will see pictures of four people for four seconds.  During this time, pay attention to all of the people that you see.  After four seconds, a box will appear around one of the people.  After one second, a sentence about that picture will appear. Your job is to decide whether these sentences are true
 or false.  <b> Press P for true and Q for false.</b>
  <br><br>
  <b>Your responses in this experiment are
  timed.  Please try to respond to each question as quickly and
 accurately as possible. </b></p>
