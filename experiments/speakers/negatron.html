 Remember, first you will see four people.  Pay attention to all four people until a red box appears around one of the people.  When the red box appears, you will see an incomplete sentence below the pictures.
<br><br>
 <b>The sentence that you see is about the picture with the box around it.</b>  Your job is to finish the sentence using only a few words.  <b> Please avoid using descriptions of the person's position relative to other characters. </b>

<div class="slide" id="practiceTwo">
  <p class="block-text"><b>Example:</b><br><br>
Here is an example.  You might see four people like this:
<center>

 <img src = "images/oranges_nothing.jpg" width="100" class="defaultPic"> 
 <img src = "images/oranges_nothing.jpg" width="100" class="defaultPic"> 
 <img src = "images/oranges_item.jpg" width="100" class="defaultPic"> 
 <img src = "images/oranges_nothing.jpg" width="100" class="defaultPic"> 

</center>

 <p class="block-text">And then after four seconds, a red box appears, like this:
<center>
 <img src = "images/oranges_nothing.jpg" width="100" class="defaultPic"> 
 <img src = "images/oranges_nothing.jpg" width="100" class="defaultPic"> 
 <img src = "images/oranges_item.jpg" width="100" class="selectedPic"> 
 <img src = "images/oranges_nothing.jpg" width="100" class="defaultPic"> 
 <br>
 Allen has <input type='text'>.
</center>
<br>
 <p class="block-text">Remember, your job is to complete the sentence using just a few words. 
<br><br>
For example, you might complete this sentence by typing "an orange", so that the sentence reads "Allen has an orange."
<br><br>
  <b> Please avoid using descriptions of the person's position relative to other characters. So, for example, do not complete the sentence by saying "second to the right". </b>
