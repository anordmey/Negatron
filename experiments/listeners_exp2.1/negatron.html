		<p class="block-text"> In this experiment, you will see pictures of four objects for four seconds.  During this time, pay attention to all of the objects that you see.  After four seconds, a box will appear around one of the objects.  After one second, a sentence about that object will appear. Your job is to decide whether these sentences are true
			or false.  <b> Press P for true and Q for false.</b>
			<br><br>
			<b>Your responses in this experiment are
				timed.  Please try to respond to each question as quickly and

						First you will have a chance to practice with some different pictures. Remember, first you will see nine objects, and you should pay attention to all four objects until a box appears around one of them.
