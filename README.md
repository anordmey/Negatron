**Experiment code** can be viewed in the "experiments" directory.  The listener condition can be viewed 
[here](http://anordmey.github.io/negatron/experiments/listeners/negatron.html) and the speaker condition can be viewed [here](http://anordmey.github.io/negatron/experiments/speakers/negatron.html).

**Raw data and analysis code** can be found in the "analysis" directory.  A analyses can be viewed [here](http://anordmey.github.io/negatron/analyses/negatron-analyses.html).

**The paper** can be found in the "paper" directory or viewed directly [here](http://anordmey.github.io/negatron/negatron.pdf).  

The paper references a prior version of the experiments that were very similar to those reported here. 
Those experiments can be viewed here: [listener condition](http://anordmey.github.io/negatron/unpublished/unpublished_experiments/listeners/negatron.html); [speaker condition](http://anordmey.github.io/negatron/unpublished/unpublished_experiments/speakers/negatron.html).
